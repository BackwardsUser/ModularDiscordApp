# idk what this app should be called...
its like a plugin based discord bot thing, so people with no coding experience can have a discord bot.
Commands, Events and other things will be able to be imported into a file.
This bot will be very community based where these "plugins" can be submitted for approval, after which the "plugins" can be used by regular people.
