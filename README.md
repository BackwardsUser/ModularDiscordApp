# A Test Discord Bot Application

A Culmative of around a year and a half of work on this project, if you have any name suggestions suggest them to me on Instagram @backwards_user
Just something I threw together, if you find a bug or issue create an issue in the issues tab (https://github.com/BackwardsUser/testDiscordApp/issues)

#IMPORTANT
Be wary of where you get commands from, Treat Discord Bot Tokens like your Passwords. You wouldn't give out your passwords.
Discord Bot Tokens can be easily syphoned. As of now there aren't any approved plugins, if you want a custom plugin just shoot me a DM and I will be happy to ablige.

Note that through-out the beta stages I will not be approving any plugins.

Suggestions? Send them to my instagram! @backwards_user

###### The current release is a closed beta, message me on Discord to get a built copy.
If you know how feel free to download the code and build it, just keep in mind that its not a clean since its in beta.

NOTE: I'm not accepting Discord friends as of this moment in time, if you want a copy and we aren't friends on Discord, shoot me a DM on instagram.


I would like to implement a saftey feature that keeps people from stealing tokens etc. from users, if you have any ideas lmk.
